# User Guide for Sunil Sadasivan


_This is a User Guide/README for Sunil Sadasivan.  This gives you a better sense of my personality and preferences :).  [Based off this template.](https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694)_

_Disclaimer: While this may appear to be rigid, defined and stated as fact, I’ve found my own preferences and working styles more dynamic and subject to change (sometimes rapidly) as I evolve through new experiences and relationships._  

## Conditions I like to work in
This depends on the task and focuses at hand.  In general, I like to optimize for 60% heads down time, 40% calls (ideally 1-1s/small groups).  I like to strive for achieving a balance with in person meetups and remote work. This is why for me, pure remote without much people interaction is something I’ve found to have challenges with, however being fully in an office is something I’m not super keen to do as well. 

I do my best work with a team that feels inspired, has a lot of momentum and individuals are keen to grow fast. 

I work best on the teams where there is high level of trust.  Teams that get aligned quickly after healthy debate (reducing the need for unnecessary, lingering debate). 

## The times/hours I like to work in
My best, individual contributor work happens in the mornings (ideally 8-11).  I prefer to have lunch, then start my afternoon for meetings/1-1s.  

I don’t mind being slacked at any time (even the days/hours I’m not fully focused on work).  I actually prefer if teammates put things on my radar when they need to, and not hold back communicating with me. 

Because I am a new dad, it is important for me to strike a good balance of work and family.  I’ve sacrificed family for work quite a bit in the past, and at this point in my life, I’m keen to find that right balance. I try to cut off slack around 5:30/6.  6-8pm is family time, and I try not to focus on work unless there is a critical incident/outage. That said, I do check in through the night and triage work/responses to be tackled, either later on at night or the following morning. 


## The best ways to communicate with me
Slack is the best way for me to get a hold of me.  I tend read everything, but triage responses. So I may not answer quickly if I’m busy or in the focus of something. 

If it’s something serious, or complex, a video call is the best approach.  I prefer to do 1-1s/small group calls rather than larger >3 people calls.  

I rarely will spend too much time on long documents/reads, unless it’s specifically called out for me to read them in depth.  

I will respond to most emails, but my timeliness will depend on how I perceive the importance may be.  With this style, I am very open to having anyone ping me (any time) if there is a pending response that I’ve missed. Please do remind me when you’re expecting something from me. 

## The way I like to receive feedback
I would prefer to receive feedback, early and often.  If there is an interaction that you may have perceived as off-putting, or prefer a different approach, I’m keen to hear it asap.  

Written feedback through Slack is completely fine (and sometimes preferable) with me.  I’ve had good interactions of feedback in slack, because it allows for the feedback and conversation to be communicated thoughtfully.  

If there is a larger, overarching theme or challenge, I would like to have a video call around it.  

I understand how very hard it is to give feedback, and so I am always, always grateful when someone has found the courage to provide it.  I am never defensive. My style is always to approach it with an open mind, and understanding that in any situation, there are two perspectives that need to be fully understood and embraced.  


## Things I need
I need to feel and portray trust on teams I work with.  If trust is prevalent, then I can delegate ownership, not tasks.  When I first join and manage a team, I will first work towards building a high level of trust (using various methods).  I will also try my hardest to earn the trust of my teammates and do this as quickly as possible. 

I need my team to let me know when it feels like trust is absent or eroding.  

I love authenticity and the idea of bringing your whole self to work. I’ve worked the best with and built deep, long lasting connections with the coworkers I feel I know deeply.  Those who share how their lives are going, what challenges their experiencing (either personal or professional) are often the ones who I’ve seen most successful.  I try to build this type of relationship with most of my teammates. 

I need balance.  I prefer to balance across IC work, meetings/1-1s, defining process and reflection. I get my best, step-function ideas for how to empower and push a team to the next level when I have the space to think. 

## Things I struggle with
I am at times disorganized.  I communicate through calls and slack, however I am not great about documentation (I’m not bad at it, and know at the level at I operate with I should be better at it)

I struggle with a defined focus.  I love to balance across disciplines, but this means my role is hard to understand for people.  I love coding, I love managing and love leading.  However I don’t focus on any discipline too deeply.  This means I’m not necessarily the best coder, I’m not the best manager, and the best leader.  I try to make incremental improvements on all fronts rather than pick a route and go down.  This makes it hard for me at times to scale with an organization.  

## Things I love

I love to see people grow and realize their potential.  I’ve been lucky enough to witness this growth progression a few times.  I look at college basketball coaches with huge admiration and they inspire me in what I do.  A personal goal of mine is to work towards having a wider footprint in terms of helping others in their career and growth potential. 

I love the tough, gritty work to help turn around teams and companies. I love the intersection of how software can empower a new level of thinking in how humans organize and operate to solve goals.  

I love to discover the truth, through experimentation. (This is the only way how imo) This means, spending little time in debate and more time in writing proof-of-concepts.  Show over Tell. 

## Other things to know about me

I use my intuition a lot. If my intuition doesn’t feel right for the team or project, then I’d prefer to leave.  That said, I still try to hone and improve who I am based on feedback and corrective actions. 

I default to trust - people will have my trust by default (vs needing to earn my trust).  

I try to live by the motto: “I am entitled the action itself, but never the fruits of the action.”   This means I continuously work towards balancing my ego, and I steer away from attributing success to anything I personally have done, knowing it's always a team effort. (no-ego doer)  Humility in my mind is critical to growth, success and overall happiness. 

I try to admit when I’m wrong, and highly respect and admire when people around me do the same.  I am in awe, when someone apologizes and owns up to mistakes.  Forgiveness is something I try to both seek and give regularly.
